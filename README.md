This repository contains my Tableau dashboard and supporting analysis from the **Deloitte Forage Data Analytics Virtual Internship**. The dashboard visualizes operational data from manufacturing factories, focusing on equipment performance and unhealthy events across different factory locations and device types.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Analyze and visualize machinery "unhealthy events" to uncover operational inefficiencies across Daikiboâ€™s global factories and various equipment types, supporting data-driven decision-making for process improvement.

- **Data Sources:**  
  - Factory telemetry event data  
  - Device-level unhealthy event logs

- **Tools Used:**  
  - **Tableau Public Edition** for data visualization  
  - Microsoft Excel for data preprocessing  

## Dashboard Breakdown                                                                                                    
 **Sheet 1**     | Bar chart comparing total unhealthy events by factory. Highlights which factory locations require attention.  |
 **Sheet 2**     | Bar chart showing unhealthy events by device type. Reveals root causes at the equipment level.                |

- **Interactivity:**  
  Both charts enable quick identification of high-risk sites and problematic machinery lines. Decision-makers can prioritize further analysis or interventions accordingly.
- **Customization:**  
  The dashboard is optimized for phone view, supporting accessibility for on-the-go insights.

## Key Insights

- **Geographic Risk:**  
  Some factories (such as Daikibo Factory Shenzhen and Daikibo Factory Meiyo) experience significantly higher unhealthy event totals compared to others. This suggests a need for targeted process review or maintenance programs at these sites.
- **Equipment Type Risk:**  
  Certain device types (like Laser Cutters) are disproportionately responsible for unhealthy events. This helps operations teams focus improvement efforts on the most problematic machinery.
- **Strategic Impact:**  
  Visual analytics provide stakeholders with actionable guidance for preventive maintenance, process optimization, and further root-cause analysis.
